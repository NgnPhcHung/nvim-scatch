# React Skill

When writing React code:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript for props interfaces
- Memoize expensive computations with useMemo
- Use useCallback for stable function references
- Avoid inline object/array literals in JSX props
