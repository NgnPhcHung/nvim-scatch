# TypeScript Skill

When writing TypeScript code:
- Use strict typing, avoid `any` and `as` type assertions
- Prefer `interface` over `type` for object shapes
- Use discriminated unions for state management
- Prefer `const` over `let`, never use `var`
- Use async/await over raw promises
- Handle errors explicitly with try/catch or Result types
